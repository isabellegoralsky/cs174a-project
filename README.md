Welcome to the fruit stand! Our customers are thirsty, and they want their smoothies now! Unfortunately, we spilled the ingredients everywhere and they're bouncing around. Help us out by clicking the necessary ingredients to fulfill the recipe!

## TDL

    - Banana shape doesnt match visual
    - Watermelon overlaps w fruits/border before colliding with it
